# Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4 #

A simple game engine to make a Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect-4 game. This is mostly being used as a 
way to learn Rust before I go on to do anything more complicated.


### Current Features ###

* Allows players to add their own name with a three character limit
* Users can select whether they want to play Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect-4 
* Keeps track of user scores per round
* After each round, users are able to change their names


### Planned Features ###
* Allow user to play on a user selected sized grid
* Format error messages to be more clear and visible
* Improve the interface by allowing the user to select a cell with arrow keys
* Allow users to change what their sprite is between rounds
* Keep track of scores outside of each round so players can keep their score until they want to switch players
